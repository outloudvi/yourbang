# yourbang
Your own !bang search, just like Duckduckgo but you can define your own bangs.

**It's not in active development since I don't use it much now, but it might be still working for Firefox nowadays. We suggest users to use !bang by DuckDuckGo by setting DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.**
